Subject: [PATCH] renderer/native: add missing eglTerminate in EGLDevice error
 path
MIME-Version: 1.0
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=UTF-8

Currently the EGLDevice code gets the display and calls eglInitialize.
As a follow-up it checks the required EGL extensions - technically it
could check the EGL device extensions earlier.

In either case, eglTerminate is missing. Thus the connection to the
display was still bound.

This was highlighted with Mesa commit d6edccee8da ("egl: add
EGL_platform_device support") + amdgpu.

In that case, since the eglTerminate is missing, we end up reusing the
underlying amdgpu_device due to some caching in libdrm_amdgpu. The
latter in itself being a good solution since it allows buffer sharing
across primary and render node of the same device.

Note: we should really get this in branches all the way back to 3.30.
